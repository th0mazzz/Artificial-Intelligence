Notes (auditing AI_pd10 4/4/2019):

Period 10 has about the same number of students
	10/16 people read the Turing Test essay

Key participants/speakers seem to be in the center of the classroom (e.g. Bill, Jonathan, Jessie)
	Help facilitate discussions immensely; possibly encourages more discussion
	Student seating is slightly more centralized
	Strong participants are seated towards the front

People are less focused on their own devices than Period 9, resulting in greater participation

Judging from the students in this classroom, their work-ethics are strong (unlike some people in Period 9)
