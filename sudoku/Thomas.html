<p>My report will be the following. I am surprised at the seemingly randomness of my smarter algorithm. It does preprocessing at the beginning
	so that it eliminates all invalid guesses from the get-go, thereby decreasing the amount of deadends that the solver needs to
	backtrack out of. It worked extremely well in some cases, but extremely poorly in other cases, which makes little sense to me. Because
	there are a ton of deadends in sudoku, I expected the smart program to have a larger impact on the results of all the sudoku boards;
	yet it only had drastic results on a limited few.</p>
