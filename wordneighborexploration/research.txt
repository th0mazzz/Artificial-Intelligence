Analysis of compound words
    We tried to answer the question "among all compound words, which word is most commonly used?" 
This turned out to be very difficult because we would sort of have to brute force it, and there 
are so many steps to the problem, such as finding the list of valid compound words, and having
to check each one for possible candidates before summing them all up and giving the answer to the
question. Due to this, we did not explore this idea. Even with Aaron's C project that allows a task
to be distributed among all of Stuy's CS lab compmuters through child processes, and using that to 
distribute the brute force, it would still take a long time.


Analysis of all words possibly created by a combination of letters(3, 4, and 5 letters long)
    Since anagrams seemed to be too easy, we decided to try to find the 3/4/5/6 letter long words 
that can be rearranged to create the most number of words of length 3/4/5/6 or less respectively.
Here are some results:

* most populous 3-letter word: yam(ma, may, am, ya, ay, my, 6) -- RUNTIME: 11.488s
* most populous 4-letter word: team(em, me, ate, ma, meat, eta, tea, am, tame, met, mate, at
                                    tam, eat, mat, 15) -- RUNTIME: 3m26.037s
* most populous 5-letter word: tapes(set, tap, pates, tea, septa, apt, seat, past, as, at, sea, spa, 
                                    sap, peats, ape, taps, apes, pat, etas, pet, pa, tape, sate, pets,
                                    east, pea, spat, pats, asp, peat, peas, spate, step, pas, pate, paste,
                                    eat, ate, tea, eats, eta, pest, sat, apse, 44) -- RUNTIME: 18m18.275s
* most populous 6-letter word: tapers(pates, rest, strep, taps, apes, tears, tape, rasp, east, reps, spate,
                                    reap, tear, teas, trap, ears, set, rats, sear, tarps, septa, seat, past,
                                    rate, asp, are, sea, peats, etas, pet, res, rep, per, re, pets, pea, pats,
                                    prate, aster, step, spare, paste, sprat, ate, tapes, taper, apter, eta,
                                    pate, spear, tares, apt, strap, art, ape, stare, arts, pares, pears, pa,
                                    rates, ares, tea, spar, spat, pare, repast, pert, rapes, rapt, parse, rat
                                    eras, rap, spa, sap, rape, sat, par, pas, pat, prates, tare, parts, sate, tars,
                                    tarp, star, peat, pear, peas, traps, eats, tsar, part, apse, 109) -- RUNTIME: 134m30.577s                                   

    As we can see, the longer the word, the harder and longer it takes for it to find all combinations. However,
    the code wasn't optimized completely, so this run time may be skewed.
