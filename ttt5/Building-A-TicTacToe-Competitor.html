<h3 class="auto-style1">Building a TicTacToe competitor</h3>
<p class="auto-style2">The next job is to create a tictactoe competition program 
that fits into the framework that allows someone to play the competitor using a 
browser.&nbsp; I have developed this framework (consisting of 3 Python3 programs 
and one webpage) that you'll need, and you can add your program to the framework 
to run TicTacToe through your browser.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The following instuctions show the requirements for your program to 
fit into the framework.&nbsp; Any program not fullfilling these requirements 
will fail to run properly and will be punished.&nbsp; As an example, let's say 
you have the program <em>fred.py</em> which is your competitor program.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">The progam will be called by the <em>python3</em> 
	program on the command-line, as in:<br />
	<em>$ python3 fred.py .... {command-line arguments}...<br />
	</em>so make sure that your preferred python interpreter is called <em>
	python3<br />
	</em>Also make sure that you can call up the Python interpreter by executing 
	the command "python3" on your command-line, either in the Mac or UNIX 
	terminal or in the CMD window on Windows.<br />
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2"><em>fred.py</em> will be called with a number of 
	command-line arguments, some of which it may ignore.&nbsp; These arguments 
	may be given <span class="auto-style3">in any order.</span>&nbsp; Here they 
	are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style2">result_prefix={<em>some-string</em>}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		This argument will be given.&nbsp; <em>fred's</em> first line of output, 
		whether to a file or to stdout, must be the string given by 
		result_prefix followed by '\n'.&nbsp; For instance, if the argument is
		<em>result_prefix=Fleep</em> then the first line of output must be <em>
		Fleep</em>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style2">result_file={<em>filename</em>}&nbsp; This 
		argument is optional.&nbsp; If provided, all output should be 
		<span class="auto-style3">appended</span> to that 
		file.&nbsp; If not provided, output should be printed.<br />
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style2">board={<em>9-char board</em>}&nbsp; This argument 
		is optional and will be given if the task is to return the best next 
		move.&nbsp; Either this argument or <em>id={anything}</em> must be 
		given.&nbsp; When this argument is provided, the output should look 
		something like this, below.&nbsp; Formatting is important: "move" is 
		lower-case, and there are no spaces around the "=" in that line.<em><br />
		Fleep<br />move=2<br />Best move:&nbsp; upper-right.&nbsp; Draw in 4 moves.</em><br />
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style2">id=<em>something</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>
		something</em> can be any value.&nbsp; This argument is optional.&nbsp; 
		If given, then <em>fred</em> will output the author and title of the 
		program.&nbsp; When this argument is provided, the output should look 
		something like this, below.&nbsp; Formatting is important: "author" and 
		"title" as lower-case and there are no spaces around the "=" in those 
		lines.<br />
		<em>Fleep<br />
		author=Beelzebub<br />
		title=The Best (v. 19.2.b)</em><br />
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style2">cutoff_time={<em>seconds</em>}&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		maximum amount of time allocated to this program.&nbsp; Feel free to 
		ignore.&nbsp; This will be enforced by the parent of this program.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">So, the program will either be called to compute the 
	next best move (when the "board=" argument is given) or to identify itself 
	(when the "id=" argument is given).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">When outputing the best move, also say it in English 
	with the appropriate future claim: (as in: "Best move: upper-right. Draw in 
	4 moves").</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Typically, you'll be given 4 seconds to compute 
	(actually, this is elapsed time, not CPU time).&nbsp; Your program should be 
	able to do this easily, without a sliderule or WolframAlpha.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">To show you how the plumbing works, I've included a 
	brilliant competitor program: TTT-Random.py which will assess its opponent's 
	personality virtues and credit score, and choose a move accordingly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Having built a competitor, it's time to try RUNNING 
	IT (omg).</p>
	</li>
</ol>
