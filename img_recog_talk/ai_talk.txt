Function f(img)
return list of 

Set of:
    SynthText (large)
    ICDAR (real data)

Convolutinonal Neural Net:
- channels and weights
- convolution of image and weights

Dogs and Cats
- train the program by examples (aka if anna is a doggo, machine will use data points and see that anna is a doggo)

min f(theta)
theta = theta - !theta f(theta)

Actual Notes

Data Augmentation
- You can rotate and shift images (and even change aspect ratio, crop), which allows you to take a small amount of image data and create large data set
  - Changes in values must be reasonable

How Machine Learning Works
y = f(x) "complicated" "handcrafted features" im very confuzzled... thank god im not going for CS major; me too ;)
feed input into black box and take gradient with respect to parameters?
can take days or weeks for a large model
it can easily memorize, but that's easy; it generalizes instead
when black box goes through training process, it learns stuff meaningful

black box
- 64 by 64 image, put through convolutional layers

very hands off??
do what works, if it does well on training data, then yeet that's great
it's just a bunch of matrices

OCR --> prediction
prediction has 6 things:
- probability that this pixel is part of word
- rectangle
  - in x,y direction, some offsets
  - prediction of bounding box of "word"
  - theta, how much to rotate the rectangle

if human can't do it, why expect machine learning to

problem is what if:
one pixel says there is a box except no other pixels nearby
solution: pick most confident pixel

most of image is not words
solution is weights:
penalize incorrect positive examples like 60 times more than missing negative examples

the ones that yall train on are the ones model is very confident but is wrong
high loss is what it is called

stages to project

- writing code for blah blah blah, debugging, etc
